Note on post-experiment handling of genetic material:

Uncontrolled transplant experiments can lead to genetic contamination of local populations [1,2] and to species invasions [3]. Although A. thaliana is a cosmopolitan plant native or naturalized to all countries where GrENE-net experiments are carried out, we ask participants to grow their replicate populations in a controlled area, preferably an institution’s ground, free from natural A. thaliana populations. Furthermore, after the experiment all used soil and plant material will be incinerated and a treatment herbicide will be used in a secured perimeter to eliminate any trace of planted seeds, as has been done before in similar outdoor experiments [4,5].
