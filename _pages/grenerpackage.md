# The grene R Package

Our team aligns with with the idea of open acces and reproducible research. As an effort towards this, we developed an R Package that includes all the analysis and metadata used in this roject. More about it can be found on its specific Github repo [here](https://github.com/moiexpositoalonsolab/grene).
