The paradigm that evolution of species is a gradual, slow process, has been challenged. There are plenty of examples, from mammals, birds, plants, insects, that evolution can be rapid. However, we are still still struggling to understand whether the genetic underpinnings and architecture of such rapid adaptations are predictable, especially in novel future climates.

With a large network of collaborators (see *Team*), we are creating a benchmark experiment to test and predict rapid evolution across climates of multiple continents. This network is called GrENE-net – Genomics of rapid Evolution in Novel Environments – and is set up as a coordinated distributed experiment with _Arabidopsis thaliana_.

Participants of this network received seed mixtures of c. 200 natural accessions of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ which they sowed into small replicated plots in 2017, which have been on their own evolving since!. The map of all the samples of growing populations for the first 3 years is below.

Every year, participants sampled plant material (one flower per successful individual) used for genome pool-sequencing throughout their reproductive stage which allowed us to track changes in the abundances of alleles and accessions. Coupled with weather and soil data, we aim to unravel the process of adaptation to different climates by directly observing it in time.

<!-- Evolution by means of natural selection is the core theme in evolutionary research. Recently, the recognition that rapid evolutionary processes occur widely in nature gave impetus to investigate adaptation of populations to their immediate environmental conditions. Understanding how rapid evolutionary processes occur in nature is of utmost relevance to investigate adaptation to rapid climate change, which has already been documented for many species at the level of phenological and distribution range shifts. Experimental evolution, where evolution is studied in action rather than as the outcome of past processes, is the gold standard in evolutionary research. Such endeavours will yield valuable insight into the process of adaptation. -->

Note on post-experiment handling of genetic material:

Uncontrolled transplant experiments can lead to genetic contamination of local populations and to species invasions. Although A. thaliana is a cosmopolitan plant native or naturalized to all countries where GrENE-net experiments are carried out, we ask participants to grow their replicate populations in a controlled area, preferably an institution’s ground, free from natural A. thaliana populations. Furthermore, after the experiment all used soil and plant material will be incinerated and a treatment herbicide will be used in a secured perimeter to eliminate any trace of planted seeds, as has been done before in similar outdoor experiments.
