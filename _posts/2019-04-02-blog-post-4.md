90 enthusiastic researchers and 40 institutions, 45 sites, 12 replicate plots per site, ~5 million seeds distributed and sown. This is how GrENE-net started. A globally distributed experiment to study how the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana may genetically evolve to different climates.

GrENE-net experiments have already grown for 1 generation, and we have exciting news: Arabidopsis is growing in many locations!

Plants successfully fought the local climate even in some very extreme regions. For example, we did not expect them to grow at all in the Negev desert (Fig. 2). Researchers are currently monitoring the second flowering generation, and the coordinators are getting the sequencing pipeline ready.

Evolution must go on!
